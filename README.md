# RayBulb Benchmark

RayBulb Benchmark is a **GPU stress test** project built with WebGL2 fragment shaders.  
It uses **Mandelbulb fractal raymarching** + **heavy supersampling** to push your device to its absolute limits — perfect for testing GPU performance on both mobile and desktop.

⚠️ **WARNING**:  
This is **not a game**. The shader is extremely heavy and may cause:
- Extreme heat 🔥  
- Rapid battery drain 🔋  
- Throttling, lag, or even crashes 💀  
Use at your own risk (**DWYOR**).
